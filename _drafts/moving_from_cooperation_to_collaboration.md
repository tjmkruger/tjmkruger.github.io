## Objective

* What is the difference between cooperation and collaboration. Why does it matter?
* How can we excercise our collaboration muscle?
* What practical excercises can help?

Growing up i spent quite a bit of time playing soccer for my local soccer club.
During this time i can clearly remember 3 different ways the teams i was part of performed.

1. #### Having individuals who were real stars
  Having these people on the team was both good and bad.
  Good for those occasion were they could run down the wing past the opposition and score.
  The times this happened though were few and far between, expecially when the rest of the team wanted a piece of the action and would avoid getting the ball to those individuals.
  The same happened in reverse, when those individuals got the ball the chances were that they'd lose the ball to the other team rather than their own.
  **In thinking about these times i see very little to no cooperation**
  *Oh and we hardly ever won any games*

2. #### Having a team that could keep up.
  Other times our team would have all the individual skills needed and just the right amount of practice to pull off some really good combinations.
  Often these combinations were from set plays.
  Kick offs, place kicks or penalties.
  With the skills spread accross the team and these combinations working for us we could take on just about any team in our league.
  **In thinking about these times i see very good cooperation**
  *Oh and we won about 50% of our games*

3. #### Having a team that shone.
  One particular year i remember our team had not only the individual skills and a list of combinations from set plays.
  But was able to put them to use at any time in any combination with so much as a glance or a gesture to teammates.
  This gave the team the ability to read the field from any players angle and come up with innovative ways to play the game.
  **In thinking back to this year i see we were collaborating**
  *Oh and we won almost all our games that year*


## Cooperation 

> Process of groups of organisms working or acting together for their common/mutual benefit, as opposed to working in competition for selfish benefit.

Some problems teams face are best solved through cooperation.

### How do we recognize cooperation:
* #### Smooth flow of work in-progress.  
  Work flows smoothly from one team member to anotherand between the team and the wider organization. This is a good goal in itself and there is no shame in stopping here.
* #### Moves toward the shared commitment. 
  Through fine-grained coordination of everyone's effort the team moves towards their commitment daily.
* #### Build Understanding.
  People talk with one another defenselessly and build understanding of the whole and of the respective parts.
* #### Achieve results.

### Where are we when we are cooperating:

Cooperation | Before Cooperation
:---: | :---:
Excitedly persue own plan | Executing assigned tasks
Face and Resolve issues in the moment | scheduling meetings a week from now

*Cooperation feels so good and works so well that you can be duped into thinking that it is collaboration. Its so much better than what i've experienced before.*

### Am I a cooperator:
* #### Agree to response-ablitiy
  Choosing to respond intentionally to whatever happens in life rather than denying or blaming.
* #### Notice silence
  Noticing when your silence has conveyed implicit consent because real "team players" don't "go along"
* #### Using your Veto power
  Using your veto power while accepting responsibiltiy for moving the group toward an acceptable solution.
* #### Reflecting
  Reflecting on your actions to recognize the interplay of your conscious and unconcious intentions
* #### Your truth not critisism
  Telling your truth with compassion instead of delivering "constructive" criticism

Ref: Teamwork is an individual skill by Christopher M. Avery

Q: Do i need a personal story for each othe the above.

### Lessons from Childhood:
* Play nice (adult: Dont fight, be fair. )
* Share (adult: Have collective ownership )
* Say your sorry even if you didn't mean it (adult: Take responsiblity for your own wake)

## Collaboration 

### Why leave collaboration to the side 
* #### If your team does not need to be innovative. 
  Specifically if the problem at hand does not call for imaginative or breakthrough thinking.
* #### Its easier to get working.
* #### Its far less emotionally and time intensive. 
  It comes to us for free. Its build into the way agile works.

Collaboration has at its core cooperation. It needs cooperation as its base but it adds the essential ingredients for yielding.

* Innovative breakthroughs
* Astonishing results
* Emergence

> When a property of a system cannot be traced back to any of the individual parts in the system, it is called an emergent property. Your personality is an emergent property of your brain. It cannot be traced back to the individual neurons.' 
Jurgen Appelo

### Ideas Emerge. 
With collaboration ideas that emerge dont come with a straight-pathway to trace back to their origins.
When collaborating, team members build on top of one anothers ideas, each person giving away their cherished vision of what it should be so that something better, that no individual could have imagined on their own, emerges from the ashes of burned and forgotten personal visions.

### A mindset for collaboration
> Arriving on time is already late.

Im sure we have all heard this before. 
I find people often focus on the timing of this. 
That is we arrive with our bodies only.
Arriving on time means that you have done whats needed to clear your mind from everthing other than the work at hand.
**If your minds not present, dont be present in body.** 
This requires each person to discover what helps them clear the clutter.
If we have about 100 people in the room, im sure, if we had to ask for what helps them clear their minds,  we would get about 150 answers in about 5 minutes. Here are a few example that i have heard.

* Listening to classical music
* Make sounds for no reason
* Look at art
* Walk the dog
* Eat breakfast

There was one person who said that making his wife breakfast in the morning helped him. 
I enjoy my sleep so im not going to even test that one.
The point is to find the ones that work for you.

Be aware of what you do. Sometimes what you do could interupt or just not be understood by those around you.

#### Story 1
We have some people at some place i work that like to scribble while in a concersation.
At firts this was really annoying for me.
To me this was not participating in the conversations.
After a while and noticing that these people are participating more than i would have expected a person thats scribbling in a book to participate I asked.
Turns out that these people scribble as a way to keep focused on the conversation.
Doesn't make much sense to me but it works for them.

#### Story 2
As Mark and i have been working together we found something like this. 
For me the walk between meetings can help me put to rest the things of the previous meeing and help me focus on the next meeting. 
At times though we would find ourselves late for a meeting. 
Now when I say late I meen just in time to be present in body. 
For Mark though this is not good enough he needs to be in the room before the meeting.
So he would walk really fast to get there early. 
This totally threw me out. 
OK long story but in the end some effort from my side to keep bigger gaps between meetings meant we could both Arrive on time.

#### Consideration
* How would standup be different if the team arrived on time (body and mind)
* Do you think they would have better ideas?
* Teams can brainstorm ideas to help the whole team to arrive on time.

### Recognizing collaboration
* #### Speak the unspeakable
  **Do people louldly and proudly declare when they have free time or are thrashing?**
  
  In most organization i've been in there is this sence that one must never look weak or give even the slightest hint that they could perform better. 
  They must appear to always be 100% flat out busy providing 110% effor at all times.
  What a weight to carry.
  *Unexpected capacity is a gift for an agile team*
* #### Build up instead of breaking down
  **Do ideas get considered by other team members and get used as raw material?**
  
  Through re-conceiving the team makes new unpredictable ideas.
  We need unpredictable if we want astonishing results.
  
  We would sometimes play the "yes but" game. This allows teams to see how they can use their individual ideas to build onto each other.
  [Explain the game]
* #### Hear all the voices
  **Do team members notice when somebody is being quiet?**

  Just like the soccer team. Unpredictable combinations can come from any person in the team. Each person sees the field from a different angle.
  Using first of 5.
  If a discussion is happening between some team members we could ask the the whole team to rate the direction.
  For example if the team is talking about getting celebrities to attend the grand opening of the companies new store and only a few have contributed to the conversation thus far, we might say, "I'm observing something about the conversation lets see what you all think. 
  Lets do a a First of Five on this statement. 
  "I am excited about this conversation and I am freely contributing my ideas. 
  Ready 1,2,3. 
  On 3 people show 1-5 fingers showing their level of agreement with the statment. 
  Invite anyone with 1-2 fingers to speak and share why the statment does not resonate with them.
* #### Nurture collaboration intimacy
  **Is the team sensing when they have gone off track.**

  Are they finishing each others sentences correctly.
  It almost seems like they are doing vulcan mind melds with each other.
* #### Gain faith in emergence
  **Do team members cluch ideas close and refuse to let them go.**

  Holding fast to "win" creates a negative self fulfilling prophecy. If a team member clutches their ideas close and refuses to let them meld and merge with others then the bigger, better idea will be blocked from comming forth.
* #### Play (seriously) together
  **Does the team recognize the hidden benefit of playing games?**

  Whe i first played planning poker with a team it was all about getting the estimates for the work.
  It was only later that i saw another benefit. We were naturally getting a rich understanding of the work to come.
  Many organizations use serious games to generate a surplus of ideas and then trim those ideas down to the ones customers will buy.

### The heart of collaboration:
* #### Direct way to innovation
  Collaboration is not the only way, but it is the most direct way to innovation.
* ####In the present
  Collaboration happens in the present time, it exists while you are doing it.
* #### Bring to the party
  To Collaborate you must know what you and your fellow collaborators bring to the party
* ####Full of love and enthusiasm
  To be full of love and enthusiasm for your work is a pre-requisite, a professional obligation. Its a choice you make and a skill you learn and practice.

### So when looking at your team ask:
* Are we cooperating
* Will cooperation serve us, or do we need collaboration?

### And remember:
* Cooperation yields: the sum of the parts.
* Collaboration yields: the whole as greater that the sum of the parts.
* Most people are already good collaborators.

> If you have a problem and to solve it you need someone else to change, you dont understand your problem yet.
