Decisions are made in a moment.
Decisions are based on the information around you at the time of making the decision.

Once you make a decision its difficult if not impossible to change your mind. 

Play out the decision.
Most people do not know how to evaluate their decisions.
Put in check points to evaluate the impact of your decision.

Your decisions impact those around you.

Influence your decisions by surrounding yourself with information that will help you make decisions in a different way.

Do not surround yourself with negative information.

To make wise decisions surround yourself with wise information.
The poeple arround you affect the information.

AS a coach all i can do is help get check points into the decision that can give quick feedback as to if the decision is having the expected result. 
I cannot always be there to give infomration at the time of a decision.

Problems -> ?? -> ?? (Ask Kevin)

Giving information once a decision is made seems to fall on unwilling ears.

Does giving information at the time of evaluating a decision help??
