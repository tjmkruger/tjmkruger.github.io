title: Picking up the balls by moving the pool

We have a little blow-up pool at home that is filled with balls.
The kids like to play in the balls.
The balls go everywhere.
Cleanup time means to pick up all the balls and get them back into the pool.

Ilia decided that moving the pool to each ball was a good idea.
Watching here i could see it was not very efficient but she was having more fun than normal.
She wanted to pick up the balls this way.

Too often we do things the way we do because it seems to us that this way is better.
And we base our decision on how it feels to us when we do it.
