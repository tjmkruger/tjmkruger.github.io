    After a few months of running a programming languages user group with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markpearl/">Mark Pearl</a> 
    we started noticing a trend among developers. They were eager to learn from each other accross not only languages but 
    in all things related to development. At the same time <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/macleanr">Robert MacLean</a> was noticing 
    the same thing. The 3 of us decided that we would close the languages user group and focus on building a community lead 
    developer user group. For developers, by developers, with the aim of sharing knowledge accross boundaries to all developers.
    The <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DeveloperUG/">DevUG</a> was born on 12 January 2006. 5 years already, wow!
