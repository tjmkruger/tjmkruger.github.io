<p>In most cases I find that software
    developers are treated as cogs in a machine that can be swapped out with another when not performing. This is a
    resource view of the world and while having great benefit in a low variability environment can be less that
    effective in the high variability environment that most software is written in. My challenge has been to have the
    conversations with all levels of the organization to see the benefits of optimizing for the flow of business value
    from idea to delivery. I have learnt to apply a level of systems thinking to problems to help teams, their managers
    and their peers to communicate better together while keeping their focus on the customer.</p>
<p>In my role as a developer coach I have engaged with all team members to focus
    their solutions on being maintainable and scalable. From the tools that they use to the principles and practices
    behind using those tools. I have facilitated the architectural designs. My goal has been to have the whole team
    understand the customerâ€™s problem and focus any decisions around solving it. There are many great tools out there
    and most of them work well. The question then is which will work for us. I believe that this is a higher-level
    discussion and when the team is involved in making that decision they will make it work.</p>
<p>Being involved with multiple teams has given me the opportunity to triangulate
    my learning and see how every environment is unique.</p>
