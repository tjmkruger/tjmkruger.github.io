    First time speaking as an international speaker. Was so tired from traveling but enjoyed some of the responses. 
    I definetly have a new respect for speakers that travel and will be more prepared next time.
    DevConf was well organised as always and even though I didn't get to deliver the talk in Cape Town the Johannesburg 
    one went well.
