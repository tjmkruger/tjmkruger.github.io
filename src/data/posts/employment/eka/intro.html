    Making the move to Australia was a big leap and had me coming out without my
    family to find a place to live and work. Being able to join the <a href="https://eka1.com" target="_blank">eka</a> team working on
    their commodity management platform was such a great opportunity. Sadly I knew when starting that my time would be
    limited as a contractor and I am going to miss all the great people. Iâ€™m sure we will continue to see each other
    well into the future, we have become good friends and you have been a great introduction into Australia and the
    workforce.

    Having a chance to work with <a href="https://www.viterra.com.au" target="_blank">Viterra</a>
    in understanding how the grain is traded was very insightful.
