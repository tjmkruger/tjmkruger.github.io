<h2>Software Developer (Team Lead)</h2>
<p>
    Its been a very good few years employed by <a href="https://paceservices.co.za" target="_blank">PaCE Services</a> as a systems developer. 
    I supported clients such as 
    <a href="https://www.exxaro.com" target="_blank">Exxaro</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.anglogoldashanti.com" target="_blank">Anglo Gold Achanti (AGA)</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.worley.com" target="_blank">WorleyParsons(TWP)</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.debeersgroup.com" target="_blank">DeBeers</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.draglobal.com" target="_blank">DRA</a> and more. Working with these big project management teams I got to 
    help build different types of mines. Working on these projects has taught me a lot about how waterfall projects are 
    run and got the opportunity compare them with an agile approach.

    I worked as the team lead on the companyâ€™s flagship product. Responsible for
    setting up and implementing the SDLC. The project was run using a combination of Agile, Lean and Waterfall methods
    to cater for stakeholder needs as well as keeping the team agile enough to deliver what was needed. Using Test
    Driven Development (TDD) and SOLID Domain Driven Design (DDD) we were able to take a high maintenance application
    built on previous generation technology and come out with something innovative and maintainable.
