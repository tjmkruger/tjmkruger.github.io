<h2>Systems / Developer Coach</h2>
<p>
    Working at Driven Alliance as a Systems Coach has given me a deep insight into organizational culture and how this can
    affect the effectiveness of a team. I firmly believe that all people are awesome and that their behavior is a reflection
    of the system they are in. At the same time its people that make up the system. I have been involved with multiple teams
    from an organizational and team level to help the team reach new levels of performance by focusing on flow.
