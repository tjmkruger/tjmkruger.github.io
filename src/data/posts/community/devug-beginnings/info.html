<p>We founded the group on a set of principles that still hold true today.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We are run by the community, for the benefit of the community.</li>
    <li>The Developer User Group is a safe space and leads with inclusion and awareness of issues in the South African developer ecosystem.</li>
    <li>We are technology agnostic. This is a place for anyone involved in software to share about their technologies, practices and tools.</li>
    <li>We are vendor neutral. We do not support any vendor or company. While we do have sponsors, they do not dictate or influence the group in any way.</li>
    <li>We believe that collaboration and discussion offers everyone involved the opportunity to improve.</li>
    <li>The Developer User Group is a true non-profit organisation.</li>
</ul>
