              I consider myself as a proficient and quick learner who adapts
              well to different work situations. Energetic, self motivated with
              excellent communication and people skills. My experience has been
              gained in challenging work environments where I have been given
              opportunities to develop certain qualities:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strong interpersonal skills</li>
              <li>Mentoring and learning from those around me</li>
              <li>Ability to work as part of a team and on own initiative</li>
              <li>Organized with productive time management skills</li>
              <li>Ability to work under pressure and meet deadlines</li>
              <li>Fast learning and competent in various software tools</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I believe that an understanding of the core principles of software
              development helps build applications that are scalable as well as
              maintainable. Therefore, I strive to learn and apply more of these
              principles every day. Currently working at{" "}

              <Quote caption="â€” Mark Pearl - Driven Software https://www.linkedin.com/in/markpearl/">
                Iâ€™ve worked with Terence for over a year in a professional
                capacity, and had associations with him in the greater software
                community for over 5 years.
                <br />
                <br />
                Terence has the ability to see things at a conceptual level and
                strategically analyse problems, both at a system and a process
                level.
                <br />
                <br />
                He has a deep knowledge of system architecture, code design and
                object orientation. He is also exceptional at helping teams
                improve, being able to map step by step what individuals need to
                develop both technically and soft skills wise.
                <br />
                <br />I would not hesitate to work with him again. I highly
                recommend him.

                Terence has been an amazing asset to the user group and a true
                innovator for the community. Though his work we expanded into
                the Pretoria region which he managed and mostly ran entirely by
                himself.
                <br />
                <br />
                Terence has proven to have a deep understanding of the community
                and been a valuable contributor in planning, organisation and
                logistics of not only the Developer User Group but also of
                DevConf
