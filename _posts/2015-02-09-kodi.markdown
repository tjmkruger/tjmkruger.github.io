I have eventually gotten around to installing [XBMC / KODI](http://kodi.tv/about). 
Since a lightning strike, followed by a motherboard replacement that caused my windows 7 media centre to stop booting, i figure its a good time to get this done. 
I have been avoiding getting this done, fearing the days of setup time to get everything working. 
Kodi really impressed me. 
Once the downloads were all done it took a total of 5 mins to have the machine booted, tested and installed. 
Since then i have spent a day playing with plugins etc. and am really glad to see media browser working. 

The one thing that i am missing is filtering by genre or year in the custom home items of the Xbmb3c plugin using media browser.
It doesn't seem to be supported as yet. 
This would make the Xbmb3c plugins custom home items more useful to me. 
I could have shortcuts for only the kids movies, this years movies etc. 
Perhaps ill look at adding this support in the future.

One of the biggest things to get past was the mounting of my external hard drives so that media browser and Kodi could access the content. 
The problem was that when the usb drives, that are formatted with NTFS, are mounted they give only the running user access for reading and writing. 
The running user in my case was mediapc as that was what i chose to call my user during installation. 
Media browser is running under the mediabrowser user. 
I had to edit my fstab to mount the drives using a known group with permissions and then add both users to that group.
For more details see the details below.

# Heres my setup:

## Getting Kodi running:

1. Download the KodiBuntu iso from here: [http://kodi.tv/download]()
2. Create a bootable USB drive from the ISO. 
4. Restart, booting from the usb again this time choosing to install Kodi
5. Follow the instructions until Kodi is running.
6. Remove the usb and re-boot.

## Install Media Browser server

To get access to the terminal use Ctl+Alt+F1 - F6 on the machine to switch to tty1 - 6 (Kodi user interface is running on tty6) or connect via ssh to the media center pc. 
To connect from windows use putty. Kodi does display its ip address at System->System Info->Network. 
I connected from my Mac using ssh and the credentials that i chose during installation of Kodi 

- `$ssh %un%@192.168.1.66`
- password: %pwd%

KodiBuntu is a derivative of Ubuntu so i followed the ubuntu instructions here: [http://mediabrowser.tv/download/](), click on linux under servers and choose ubuntu.

- `$sudo add-apt-repository ppa:apps-z/mediabrowser`
- `$sudo apt-get update`
- `$sudo apt-get install mediabrowser`
- `$service mediabrowser start`
- visit http://localhost:8096/mediabrowser

## Install Media Browser Kodi plugin

I followed the instructions here: [http://mediabrowser.tv/download]()

- Download the plugin repository zip file.
- Install using System -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file
- Install the Kodi add-on from the repository
- Install your skin of choice from the Kodi repository. I am using the 1080XF MB3 skin.

## Create a group to use when mounting the usb drives

- Add a new group to use for media admin: `$sudo groupadd mediaadmin`
- Add the user running kodi (in my case mediapc) to the media admin group: `$sudo usermod -a -G mediaadmin mediapc`
- Find the user that is running mediabrowser: `ps aux | grep mediabrowser`
- Add the mediabrowser user to the media admin group: `$sudo usermod -a -G mediaadmin mediabrowser`
- Check the two users belong to the mediaadmin group: `groups mediapc` and `$groups mediabrowser`. Should see mediaadmin in each case.

## Mount the usb drive

- Find the hard drives UUID: `$sudo blkid`
- Edit the fstab: `$sudo vim /etc/fstab`
- Add a line for the drive you are mounting: 
  - `UUID=4CE4D97AE4D966AC /media/Movies auto umask=000,gid=mediaadmin`
  - The umask is in the format user-group-all where 0 is all permissions and 7 is no permissions.
  - I am giving all other users full permissions so that i can manage the files later when i mount the remote file system locally.
- Restart to allow and test that the drives mount with the required permissions. 
- Check the permissions: `$ls -l /media`
  - Should see: drwxrwx- - - root mediaadmin ... Movies

## Point Media Browser to the files

- Open the browser to: %ipaddress%:8096/mediabrowser
- Navigate to Library
- Add the  media folders

## Views

I like the Xbmb3c 1080XF skin for its home screen.
For some of the views once navigating i like the following:

- For the Movies and Series names view i like: Panel 
- For the Series details (season list and episode list) i like: Info List

## Managing Files

To manage files I find the best is to mount the remote file system via ssh to the local machine. 
Once this is done manage the files as normal.
To do this use one of the following:

- Ubuntu / Debian: `$sudo apt-get install sshfs`
- Mac: Get FUSE and sshfs from the [osxfuse site](http://osxfuse.github.io/)
- Windows: Get the latest package from the google code repo. [Direct Link](https://win-sshfs.googlecode.com/files/win-sshfs-0.0.1.5-setup.exe)

[More info here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sshfs-to-mount-remote-file-systems-over-ssh)

- Create a local directory as a mount point: `$mkdir ~/Documents/MediaPC`
- Create the mount point: `$sshfs mediapc@192.168.1.66:/ ~/Documents/MediaPC`
- To unmount: `$umount ~/Documents/MediaPC`
Now work with the files.

## Setup utorrent for new content

[Install UTorrent](http://2buntu.com/articles/1307/installing-utorrent-server-on-ubuntu/) \ [Start utorrent-server on startup](http://ubuntumind.blogspot.com/2011/02/utorrent-on-ubuntu.html)

- Found the latest uTorrent server here: [http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/linux]()
- Extract the package: `$tar -zvxf ~/Downloads/utorrent-server-3.0.tar.gz`
- Move the folder to users bin: `$sudo mv utorrent-server-3.0 /usr/bin/utorrent-server`
- Set exec permissions: `$sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/bin/utorrent-server`
- Create the init script: `$sudo touch /etc/init.d/utorrent`
- Set the init scripts exec permissions: `$sudo chmod -R 777 /etc/init.d/utorrent`
- Add the below to the init script replacing:
  - CHDIR: /usr/bin/utorrent-server
  - USER: mediapc
- Start utorrent when pc starts: `sudo update-rc.d utorrent defaults`
- Start the service: `$sudo /etc/init.d/utorrent start`
- Create the needed download folders:
  - `$mkdir /media/Series2/Downloads/complete`
  - `$mkdir /media/Series2/Downloads/incomplete`
  - `$mkdir /media/Series2/Downloads/torrents`
  - `$mkdir /media/Series2/Downloads/complete-torrents`
- Open a web browser [http://192.168.1.66:8080/gui]()
- Set the default directories under settings->directories:
  - new downloads: /media/Series2/Downloads/incomplete
  - completed: /media/Series2/Downloads/complete
  - torrents: /media/Series2/Downloads/torrents
  - completed torrents: /media/Series2/Downloads/completed-torrents
