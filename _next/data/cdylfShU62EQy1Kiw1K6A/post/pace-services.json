I supported clients such as <a href=\"https://www.exxaro.com\" target=\"_blank\">Exxaro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.anglogoldashanti.com\" target=\"_blank\">Anglo Gold Achanti (AGA)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.worley.com\" target=\"_blank\">WorleyParsons(TWP)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.debeersgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\">DeBeers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.draglobal.com\" target=\"_blank\">DRA</a> and more. Working with these big project management teams I got to help build different types of mines. Working on these projects has taught me a lot about how waterfall projects are run and got the opportunity compare them with an agile approach. </p> <p> I worked as the team lead on the companyâ€™s flagship product. Responsible for setting up and implementing the SDLC. The project was run using a combination of Agile, Lean and Waterfall methods to cater for stakeholder needs as well as keeping the team agile enough to deliver what was needed. Using Test Driven Development (TDD) and SOLID Domain Driven Design (DDD) we were able to take a high maintenance application built on previous generation technology and come out with something innovative and maintainable. </p>","card":{"content":"While I'm ending my time at Pace Services, I am thankful for the opportunity and happy to have made friends for life.","image":{"file":"Blog/Costing.jpg","alt":"Terence at Pace Service's dress up year end function with the development team"}},"content":[{"type":"image","content":{"file":"Blog/pace-collage.jpg","caption":"From work colleagues to friends for life.","alt":"Collage showing Terence enjoying end year functions, birthdays and weddings with friends from Pace Services"}},{"type":"html","content":"<h2>Responsibilities:</h2> <ul> <li> <p>Coordinating the development team.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scope, plan and execute projects.</p> </li> <li> <p>Corresponding with clients (determining requirements according to their needs)</p> </li> <li> <p>Designing and developing applications to suite the customer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Updating existing applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Writing of support manuals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Training of Clients on all systems</p> </li> <li> <p>Server / Workstation setups</p> </li> <li> <p>Setup continuous integration</p> </li> <li> <p>Setup testing environments</p> </li> </ul> "},{"type":"html","content":"<h2>Experience Gained</h2> <ul> <li> <p>5+ years Design and Development experience in:</p> <p>Languages:</p> <ul> <li> <p>C# .NET</p> </li> <li> <p>ASP .Net (Web-Forms and MVC)</p> </li> <li> <p>Java Script </p> </li> <li> <p>HTML5</p> </li> <li> <p>CSS3</p> </li> <li> <p>SQL</p> </li> <li> <p>Node JS</p> </li> </ul> <p>Tools:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Knockout, Angular.js</p> </li> <li> <p>JQuery, Jasmine, D3.js</p> </li> <li> <p>Dev Express</p> </li> <li> <p>NUnit, MS Test</p> </li> <li> <p>NHibernate</p> </li> <li> <p>Entity Framework</p> </li> <li> <p>MVC 3 / 4</p> </li> <li> <p>Visual Studio 2010 / 2012</p> </li> <li> <p>Microsoft SQL Server</p> </li> <li> <p>SVN, Mercurial, Git</p> </li> <li> <p>Teamcity</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Object Orientated programming (OOP)</p> </li> <li> <p>Application and Website Testing and Debugging</p> </li> <li> <p>Systems Analysis</p> </li> <li> <p>Database Design and Development (SQL Server)</p> </li> <li> <p>Server side programming and implementation</p> </li> <li> <p>Business integration</p> </li> <li> <p>Project management methodologies and skills</p> </li> </ul>"}],"organisation":"PaCE Services","categories":["software"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
